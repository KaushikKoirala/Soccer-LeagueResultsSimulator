# Soccer League Results Simulator
Program that can print to console various possible results, statistics, and simulations, given a number of games that are played in that soccer league in one season. 


## Premise Behind the Program
In soccer leagues throughout the world, rankings are computed by assigning 3 points for every win a team in that league gets, 1 point for every draw, and 0 points for every loss. Given that this is the case, it can lead to some very interesting results. For example, in  a 38 game season (as is the standard in many European leagues), a team with 12 wins, 6 draws, and 20 losses will have finished level on points in the standings with a team with 14 wins, 0 draws, and 24 losses as they both would have 42 points.
